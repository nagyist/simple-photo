SimplePhoto is a lightweight and low footprint application that allows the conversion of batches of photos. For the time being it only allows very simple operations such as changing the filetype, changing the photo’s size (including cropping) and grouping photos by dirs, dates or just flattening the hierarchy.

SimplePhoto was developed in C++ using Eclipse CDT and in a later stage QtCreator (UI was created using wxFormBuilder). It stacks on top of wxWidgets and GraphicsMagick (I was initially using ImageMagick but had to change when I bumped into a PNG decoding bug…).

Currently I have compiled SimplePhoto for Mac OS X (Leopard and Snow Leopard) and for Windows XP and newer. I still haven’t compiled the Linux version mostly because I haven’t had the time to install a linux VM image. Will do that in the due time but for now my top priority is to make the source code for SimplePhoto available under Apache License.
